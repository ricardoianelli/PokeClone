This scene is a simple prototype of a game made with assets available in Unity.

In the scene there are four types of units:
- Archer (represented by a sphere)
- Spearman (represented by a cube)
- Paladin (represented by a capsule)
- Hero (represented by a cylinder)

Units have the following weaknesses:
 - Archer -> weak against Paladin
 - Spearman -> weak against Archer
 - Paladin -> weak against Spearman

Hero has a few special abilities:
- Heal adjacent friendly units (passive ability)
- Boost defence of adjacent friendly units (passive ability)
- Once in a game boost his attack by 2 for duration of 3 turns
  The ability is activated with a button next to the unit
